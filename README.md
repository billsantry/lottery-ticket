# 🎮 NOT A LOTTERY TICKET: 8-BIT FUTURES

A retro arcade strategy game inspired by Peter Thiel’s talk  
**“You Are Not a Lottery Ticket.”**

Choose a worldview.  
Allocate resources.  
Shape your future across 12 years.  

Experience how philosophy turns into outcomes.

## 🧠 The Backstory

In his talk *“You Are Not a Lottery Ticket,”* Peter Thiel argues that the future is not random. It is shaped by whether individuals and societies adopt:

- **Determinate** vs. **Indeterminate**
- **Optimism** vs. **Pessimism**

This game operationalizes that framework.

Instead of debating the ideas, you **play them**.

## 🌍 The Worldviews

Each run begins by selecting one of four philosophical stances:

### 🔵 Determinate Optimism (DO)
Specific plans. Conviction. Concentrated bets. Long-term compounding.

> The future can be designed.

---

### 🟣 Indeterminate Optimism (IO)
Diversification. A/B testing. Process optimization. Optionality.

> The future improves statistically.

---

### 🟢 Determinate Pessimism (DP)
Rationing. Fortress strategy. Reserves. Survival-first allocation.

> The future is constrained. Plan accordingly.

---

### 🟠 Indeterminate Pessimism (IP)
Insurance. Hedging. Compliance. Risk minimization.

> The future is uncertain and hostile.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Navigate 12 simulated years.

You allocate:

- 💰 Money  
- 🧠 Focus  
- ⏳ Time  
- ⭐ Reputation  

Events respond to your worldview and resource strategy.

Some paths compound.  
Some drift.  
Some collapse.  
Rare breakthroughs are possible — but never guaranteed.

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

Open:

```bash
index.html
```

That’s it.

No dependencies.  
No build step.  
No server required.

---

### Modes

**1-Player**  
A solo 12-year strategic run.

**2-Player (Hot-Seat)**  
Take turns. Shared world events. Competing philosophies.

---

### Controls

- Mouse clicks  
- Keyboard selection  
- End Year button to advance  
- React to events as they occur  

The system tracks long-term consequences invisibly.  
Short-term wins can create long-term fragility.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- Single static HTML file  
- Embedded CSS  
- Embedded JavaScript  
- Seeded randomness  
- State-driven event engine  
- No frameworks  
- No external dependencies  

Deployable anywhere static files are served.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

Because it’s one file, you can deploy it to:

- GitHub Pages  
- Azure Static Web Apps  
- Netlify  
- Amazon S3  
- Cloudflare Pages  
- Or simply double-click the file locally

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This is not meant to be a balanced game.

It is meant to be a **philosophical simulation**.

The mechanics encode worldview assumptions:

- Concentration vs diversification  
- Conviction vs process  
- Planning vs hedging  
- Compounding vs drift  

The goal is not to “win.”

The goal is to feel why certain strategies produce certain patterns over time.

---

## 🧩 Why 8-Bit?

The retro arcade aesthetic reinforces:

- Determinism  
- Limited inputs  
- Structured systems  
- Visible feedback loops  

Underneath the pixel art is a model of modern economic philosophy.

---

## 🛠️ Future Ideas

- AI opponent that plays according to worldview  
- Expanded event library  
- State-reactive sound design  
- Visualization of hidden variables  
- Post-run philosophical summary analysis  
- Exportable run logs
